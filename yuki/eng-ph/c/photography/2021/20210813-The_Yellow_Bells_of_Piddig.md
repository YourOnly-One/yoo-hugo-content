In the National Capital Region, a highly urbanised metropolitan, seeing flowers randomly is almost impossible for decades now. Thus, when we went to Ilocos Norte, Philippines a few years back, I had the opportunity to see these beautiful Yellow Bell flowers growing in the home that we went to. This was the first time I saw a Yellow Bell up close, I've only seen this in school textbooks.

Here are a few photos I took.

## What is a Yellow Bell flower?
A Yellow Bell flower, or its Scientific classification *Allamanda cathartica*, is a species of the genus *Allamanda*. *A. cathartica* is a yellow flower like most species of the genus *Allamanda*. It is also known as "golden trumpet" and "yellow allamanda". The genus name *Allamanda* was given in honour of the Swiss botanist and physician Frédéric-Louis Allamand (1736-1809).[^a]
