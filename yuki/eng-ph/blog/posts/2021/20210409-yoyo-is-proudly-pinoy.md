Did you know? "Yo-yo" was invented by a Filipino. It was a design by ***Pedro Flores*** and first sold in 1928 under his company *Yo-yo Manufacturing Company* in Santa Barbara, California. The word "Yo-yo" and the modern design of this ancient toy is proudly Pinoy.

## Etymology and history
While the toy itself is ancient and is known by various names such as *diabolo* in China (approximately 1000 BCE) and *bandalore* in the 17<sup>th</sup> century, the modern word "Yo-yo" and the modern design of a yo-yo was pretty much recent.

The word "yo-yo" probably came from the Ilokano word "yóyo", or a cognate word in a language in the Philippines.[^b]

In 1928, Pedro Flores, a Filipino immigrant to the United States of America, opened the "Yo-yo Manufacturing Company" in Santa Barbara, California. The business started with a dozen handmade toys; by November of 1929, Flores was operating two additional factories in Los Angeles and Hollywood, which all together employed 600 workers and produced 300,000 units daily.[^a]

The principal distinction between the Filipino design popularized by Flores and more primitive yo-yos is in the way the yo-yo is strung. In older (and some remaining inexpensive) yo-yo designs, the string is tied to the axle using a knot. With this technique, the yo-yo just goes back and forth; it returns easily, but it is impossible to make it sleep. In Flores's design, one continuous piece of string, double the desired length, is twisted around something to produce a loop at one end which is fitted around the axle. Also termed a *looped slip-string*, this seemingly minor modification allows for a far greater variety and sophistication of motion, thanks to increased stability and suspension of movement during free spin.[^a]

## Trademark
Pedro Flores was not the one who trademarked the name "Yo-yo" for this modern design of the ancient toy. It was registered as a trademark in 1932 by Sam Dubiner in Vancouver, Canada.[^a]

However, in a trademark case in 1965, a federal court of appeal ruled in favor of the Royal Tops Company, the court explained that "*yo-yo*" had become a part of common speech and that Duncan (who bought Flores's "Yo-yo" company) no longer had exlusive rights to the term.[^a]

## Conclusion
Whenever we use the word *yo-yo*, remember that it was originally a company name "Yo-yo Manufacturing Company" and originated from languages in the Philippines. In addition to that, whenever we see and/or play *yo-yo*, also remember that the modern design we are enjoying today was made by **Pedro Flores** in 1928 who provided jobs for 600 workers.
