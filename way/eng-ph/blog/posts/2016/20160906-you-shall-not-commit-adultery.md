<sup>[14]</sup> "You shall not commit adultery."
{{% /quotebox %}}

## What is "adultery"?
According to *Google*, adultery is a voluntary sexual intercourse between a married person and a person who is not his or her spouse.

As simple as that. However, there is more to it that warrants a separate study. For now, the simple yet powerful command to not commit adultery, in the way we understood it today, is enough for our meditation.

Shalom!
