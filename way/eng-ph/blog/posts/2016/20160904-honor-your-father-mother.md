The commandment for today we should meditate is the 5<sup>th</sup> commandment, that, I am sure, all of us fell short and are guilty of breaking.

<sup>[12]</sup> "Honor your father and your mother, so that your days shall be prolonged in the land which <bdo dir="rtl" lang="hbo-Hebr">𐤉𐤄𐤅𐤄</bdo> (YAHUAH/YAHUWAH) your Aluahim gives you.

## What is "honor"?
According to *Google Search*, honor as noun means (a) high respect; esteem; and (b) a privilege.

## How to give "honor"?
Yet again, according to *Google Search*, to give honor is to (a) regard a person with great respect; and to (b) fulfill (as to an obligation) or keep (an agreement).

## The 4<sup>th</sup> Commandment
To honor your father and your mother then means we give them a high and great respect and to fulfill our obligation to them as is expected by man (society; culture) and <bdo dir="rtl" lang="hbo-Hebr">𐤉𐤄𐤅𐤄</bdo> (YAHUAH/YAHUWAH) our Aluahim.

The question that many asks is what if what our fathers and mothers were doing and is asking of us is against the laws of the land and of <bdo dir="rtl" lang="hbo-Hebr">𐤉𐤄𐤅𐤄</bdo> (YAHUAH/YAHUWAH)? Then, politely refused, especially if it is against <bdo dir="rtl" lang="hbo-Hebr">𐤉𐤄𐤅𐤄</bdo> (YAHUAH/YAHUWAH). However, humiliating them to the public or fighting with them is, no doubt, goes against this very commandment.

An example is turning our parents over to the authorities. Yes, they may have violated the law of man, but the law of <bdo dir="rtl" lang="hbo-Hebr">𐤉𐤄𐤅𐤄</bdo> (YAHUAH/YAHUWAH) is greater. We are to honor our fathers and mothers. We are not to speak ill of them nor bear witness against them.

Yet another is disobeying them when their decision is sound and does not goes against the law of man and especially not the Law of <bdo dir="rtl" lang="hbo-Hebr">𐤉𐤄𐤅𐤄</bdo> (YAHUAH/YAHUWAH). Like it or not, they do know what is best for their children. They have been there and they have done the things that we, as children, have no idea of the consequences.

## Meditate
Thus, today, let us meditate on this. Did we honor our father and mother the Scriptural way? Did we say, even in passing, things that dishonors them? Or did we put them in high regard when we hear ill words spoken against them?

Bringing flowers is one thing. Honor is truly shown by standing up for them and only remembering the good things they have done. Ever experienced those moments when you felt you are dishonoring them with what you were saying or doing? Ever felt that pang in your chest? Or that uneasiness in your soul?

Shalom my brethren!
