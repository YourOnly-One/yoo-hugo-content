A very simple commanment, correct? But one that all of us, no doubt, have transgressed on far too many times to count. Stealing is stealing, be it a very small amount, say 1¬¢ only or a huge amount, like taking over of a company by ways that is against the law.

<sup>[15]</sup> "You shall not steal."
{{% /quotebox %}}

Not paying our taxes is stealing. Encoding films and putting it online is stealing (downloading these files is not stealing, it will be discussed another time). Not giving to <bdo lang="hbo-Hebr" dir="rtl">ê§âê§Ñê§Öê§Ñ</bdo> (YAHUAH/YAHUWAH) what is His, all glory, honor, praise, and thanks, is stealing (and can be considered idolatry too, which is a transgression of the 2<sup>nd</sup> commandment).

Last, but definitely not the least, worshipping on the wrong Sabbath day is stealing. Which is also a transgression of the 4<sup>th</sup> commandment. A commandment that is side-by-side with today's 8<sup>th</sup> commandment. **Sun**day is definitely and no doubt, the wrong Sabbath day.

Let's meditate on it today as we prepare for the coming of the Day of Atonement.

Shalom!
