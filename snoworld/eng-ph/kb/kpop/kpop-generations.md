## Criteria
Criteria is simple, whichever is earliest:
* First song release date; or
* First public performance ("as a group" if a group)

## Length
Each generation is 10 calendar years which started in 1992 when the boy group Seo Taiji & Boys debuted with music considered as "modern K-Pop".
* 1st Gen: 1992–2001
* 2nd Gen: 2002–2011
* 3rd Gen: 2012–2021
* 4th Gen: 2022–2031
* 5th Gen: 2032–2041

This is the most objective way to define the different generations of K-Pop. If we include criteria like "they used social media", "their music genre", and "fashion style", to mention a few, then it becomes subjective—the reason why we too many different "K-Pop Generation" theories. Why make it confusing when we can just stick to a fixed and objective method that we can all easily agree on?

Subjective lists are fine but to put order into chaos an objective approach should always be an option.
